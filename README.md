It is an academic mini project which is done by me, Akash Paul Reddy Sama, Vasisht Kumar Miryalkar. The project's title is IoT based air pollution monitoring system
## Abstract
The aim of this work is to take up the burning issue of air pollution by designing an IoT-based air quality monitoring system. Integration of sensors, microcontrollers, and web server technologies in the structure allows tracking real-time pollution from a distant location. The significance that draws from this paper is, therefore, the provision of a cheap and easily available option regarding monitoring and controlling air pollution, which might also be applied in environmental monitoring and health. This basically means having a system to help keep the air quality in check, regardless of one's location, and alert the individual if the pollution surpasses the recommended limits.Through this, they are looking at how they can combine some essentials - sensors, microcontrollers, and web server technology - to facilitate instant tracking and access from a distance. The problem it solves is the lack of enough methods for monitoring air purity in a faster way and also the need to be able to check for pollutants at a distant place. The output of the sensor gets calibrated to give an accurate reading. It interfaces through the library with MQ135, MQ2, DHT11 sensors. Through Serial Communication and Flask, it shows in an html page in a real-time base, data of the air quality readable from any browser.
